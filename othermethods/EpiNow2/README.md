# EpiNow2

Simple worked examples of fitting [EpiNow2](https://epiforecasts.io/EpiNow2/).

We implement two versions:
- The default version with a log-normal prior distribution for the G.P. lengthscale $\ell$
- A version using an inverse-gamma prior distribution for $\ell$

These are provided in ``EpiNow2-example.R`` and ``EpiNow2-invgamma-example.R`` respectively.
