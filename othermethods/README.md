# Other methods

We provide simple worked examples for other methods in this folder. Results from these scripts are documented in the supplementary material of our paper (#TODO) and on the ![corresponding website](https://nicsteyn2.github.io/RobustRtEstimators/OtherMethods.html).

While each implementation is different, each model folder generally contains:
- An example script that generates fits the model to the example data
- ``results.csv`` and ``params.csv`` files the contain results from the model fit, in a relatively standard format
- Supporting files that contain custom extensions, such as CRPS estimators

We also provide (in this folder), ```exampledata.csv```, which contains the example data used. The results are aggregated in scripts contained in the ``/results/`` folder.

Where copyright permits, we provide the source code to reproduce our results.
