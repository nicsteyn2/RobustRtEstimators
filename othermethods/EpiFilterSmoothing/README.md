# EpiFilter (smoothing)

Simple worked example fitting the smoothing version of EpiFilter. Note here that *smoothing* refers to the smoothing posterior distribution $P(R_t|C_{1:T})$ (which uses on past and future data) in contrast to the *filtering* distribution $P(R_t|C_{1:t})$ (which uses on past data only).
